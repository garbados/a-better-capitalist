A better capitalist, or ABC for short, is a neural net trained to beat the market. Currently experimental.

## What? Why?

Capitalism makes sense for machines, and machine capitalists could [destroy the world](http://garbados.github.io/recent_stories/#/story/robot_capitalism.md). I want to test that hypothesis, and mess around with neural nets.

A better capitalist is an automated trading bot for human stock markets like the NYSE. It's trained on historical stock data and news articles going back as far as possible, and ideally is able to pay for its own maintenance and upkeep. Just configure it, start it, and leave it alone. ABC does the rest.

## Install
