# An Accelerationist Manifesto

In brief, the accelerationism described in this document does not aim to run capitalism to its logical and disastrous conclusion, but to give the lie to the hegemony that uses capitalist mechanisms to establish, extend, and fortify its powers of exploitation.

Capitalism, defined within this document as the lived systems of finance-oriented oppression wherein employers control the means to survival itself, maintains a mythology of concepts like The Invisible Hand and Efficient Markets that naturalizes the global hegemony and deflects responsibility for the consequences of that hegemony's behavior. This mythology is a shield. An economic agent that could predict the behavior of markets more effectively than the agents of the hegemony could force them to abandon capitalism as a means of domination.

Such a theoretical agent would not need to rely on a market being efficient. It would require only that the agents constituting that market are observable and predictable. Behavioral economics suggests humans are irrational agents, but in predictable fashions based on their circumstances. Thus, a sufficient intelligence could predict even insider trading and other anti-market behaviors. Regulators could use such an intelligence to punish agents using markets to perpetuate exploitation; revolutionaries could use it to fund other forms of direct action against the bourgeoisie.

For example, an agent that could have known about [the Libor scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libor_scandal) by correlating environmental circumstances with its understanding of human behavior could have beaten the market, and even the architects of the scandal itself.

Moreover, finance giants like Goldman Sachs [profit primarily from anti-market behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs#Controversies) such as obfuscating the behavior of its own financial instruments, deriving profits from economic disasters of its own making, and facilitating the impoverishment of sovereign nations under its advisement. An agent capable of predicting their manipulations could destroy them as an agent of financial exploitation.

Through `a-better-capitalist` we attempt to create such an intelligent agent. It represents only a single approach to disarming the bourgeoisie through global markets. Unlike [other nerds calling themselves accelerationists](http://criticallegalthinking.com/2013/05/14/accelerate-manifesto-for-an-accelerationist-politics/), the authors of this document take no issue with the modern radical left, its methodologies, or its material manifestations. This document and its politics aim to explore methods of direct action made possible by emerging technological circumstances that could assist us in cultivating a more humane future.

To summarize, accelerationism supposes that capitalism as we know it today is a system made possible by modern technological circumstances, and maintained by an exploitive hegemony. However, the dynamics of capitalism do not necessarily support that hegemony. Modern markets are modern inventions. They contain vulnerabilities that disadvantage the hegemony. Developing agents that capitalize on those vulnerabilities could force the hegemony to abandon capitalism as a means of domination, and arm the radical left with a means to defeat the bourgeoisie on their own terms.
